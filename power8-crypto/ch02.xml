  <title>Vector programming</title>
  <para>Several topics need to be discussed to minimize trouble when using the Altivec and POWER8 extensions. They include PowerPC compilers and options, Altivec headers, machine endianness, vector datatypes, memory and alignment, and loads and stores. It is enough information to get to the point you can use AES and SHA but not much more.</para>
  <para>Memory alignment, loads, stores and shifts will probably cause the most trouble for someone new to PowerPC vector programming. If you are new to the platform you may want to read this chapter twice. If you are experienced with the platform then you probably want to skip this chapter.</para>
  <section id="power8_compilers">
    <title>PowerPC compilers</title>
    <para>Two compilers are used for testing. The first is GCC and the second is IBM XL C/C++ (XLC). Both produce high quality code. LLVM's Clang was not tested. The compile farm lacks a Clang installation.</para>
    <para>The GCC and XLC compilers are mostly the same but accept slightly different options. The difference usually reduces to GCC accepts architecture options using <systemitem>-march</systemitem> and <systemitem>-mcpu</systemitem>, while XLC uses <systemitem>-qarch</systemitem>.</para>
    <para>Compiling a test program with GCC will generally look like below. The important part is <systemitem>-mcpu=power8</systemitem> which selects the POWER8 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).</para>
    <programlisting>$ g++ -mcpu=power8 test.cxx -o test.exe
</programlisting>
    <para>Compiling a test program with IBM XL C/C++ will generally look like below. The important parts are the C++ compiler name of <systemitem>xlC</systemitem>, and <systemitem>-qarch=pwr8</systemitem> which selects the POWER8 ISA.</para>
    <programlisting>$ xlC -qarch=pwr8 -qaltivec test.cxx -o test.exe
</programlisting>
    <para>Both compilers consume <systemitem>-g</systemitem> and <systemitem>-O3</systemitem>. If you want Position Independent Code then use <systemitem>-fPIC</systemitem> for GCC and <systemitem>-qpic</systemitem> for XLC.</para>
    <para>If you work on the <link linkend="intro_cfarm">Compile Farm</link> then be mindful of the default GCC compiler. It may be GCC 4.8.5 which is a bit old and unsupported. You usually enjoy better code generation and performance with a modern GCC like 7.2. A newer compiler is usually located at <systemitem>/opt/cfarm/gcc-latest</systemitem>.</para>

  <section id="power8_endianess">
    <title>Machine endianness</title>
    <para>You will experience both little-endian and big-endian machines in the field when working with a modern PowerPC architecture. Linux is generally little-endian, while AIX is big-endian.</para>
    <para>When writing portable source code you should check the value of preprocessor macros <systemitem>__LITTLE_ENDIAN__</systemitem> or <systemitem>__BIG_ENDIAN__</systemitem> to determine the configuration. The value of the macros <systemitem>__BIG_ENDIAN__</systemitem> and <systemitem>__LITTLE_ENDIAN__</systemitem> are defined to non-0 to activate the macro. Source code checking endianness should look similar to the code shown below.</para>
    <programlisting>#if __LITTLE_ENDIAN__

  <section id="power8_alloc">
    <title>Memory allocation</title>
    <para>System calls like <systemitem>malloc</systemitem> and <systemitem>calloc</systemitem> (and friends) are used to acquire memory from the heap. The system calls <emphasis>do not</emphasis> guarantee alignment to any particular boundary on all platforms. Linux generally returns a pointer that is at least 16-byte aligned on all platforms, including ARM, PPC, MIPS and x86. AIX <emphasis>does not</emphasis> provide the same <ulink url="http://stackoverflow.com/q/48373188/608639">alignment behavior</ulink>.</para>

    <para>AIX provides routines for vector memory allocation and alignment. They are <systemitem>vec_malloc</systemitem> and <systemitem>vec_free</systemitem>, and you can use them like <systemitem>_mm_malloc</systemitem> on Intel machines with Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE).</para>

The suffix <systemitem>_p</systemitem> (for POWER architecture) or <systemitem>_v</systemitem> (for Vector) would work just as well.</para>

  <section id="power8_shift">
    <title>Vector shifts</title>
    <para>Altivec shifts and rotates are performed using <emphasis>Vector Shift Left Double by Octet Immediate</emphasis>. The vector shift and rotate built-in is <systemitem>vec_sld</systemitem> and it compiles/assembles to <systemitem>vsldoi</systemitem>. Both shift and rotate operate on a concatenation of two vectors. Bytes are shifted out on the left and shifted in on the right. The instructions need an integral constant in the range 0 - 15, inclusive.</para>
    <para>Vector shifts and rotates perform as expected on big-endian machines. Little-endian machines need a special handling to produce correct results and the <ulink url="http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSXVZZ_13.1.4/com.ibm.xlcpp1314.lelinux.doc/compiler_ref/vec_sld.html">IBM manuals don't tell you about it</ulink>. If you are like many other developers then you will literally waste hours trying to figure it out what happened the first time you experience it.</para>
    <para>The issue is <ulink url="http://stackoverflow.com/q/46341923/608639">shifts and rotates are endian sensitive</ulink>, and you have to use <systemitem>16-n</systemitem> and swap vector arguments on little-endian systems. The C++ source code provides the following template function to compensate for the little-endian behavior.</para>
    <programlisting>template &lt;unsigned int N, class T&gt;
T VecShiftLeft(const T val1, const T val2)
{
#if __LITTLE_ENDIAN__

    return vec_sld(val1, val2, R);
#endif

</programlisting>
    <para>A <systemitem>VecRotateLeft</systemitem> would be similar to the code below, if needed. Rotate is a special case of shift where both vector arguments are the same value.</para>

  <section id="power8_permute">
    <title>Vector permutes</title>
    <para>Vector permutes allow you to rearrange elements in a vector. The values to be permuted can be in any arrangement like 64x2 or 32x4, but the mask is always an octet mask using an 8x16 arrangement.</para>
    <para>The Altivec permute is very powerful and it stands out among architectures like ARM, Aarch64 and x86. The instruction allows you to select elements from two source vectors. When an index in the mask is in the range <systemitem>[0,15]</systemitem> then elements from the first vector are selected, and index values in the the range <systemitem>[16,31]</systemitem> select elements from the second vector.</para>
    <para>As an example, suppose you have a big-endian byte array like a message to be hashed using SHA-256. SHA operates on 32-bit words so the message needs a shuffle on little-endian systems. The code to perform the permute on a little-endian machine would look like below.</para>
    <programlisting>uint32x4_p msg = vec_ld(/*load from memory*/);
uint8x16_p mask = {3,2,1,0, 7,6,5,4, 11,10,9,8, 15,14,13,12};
msg = vec_perm(msg, msg, mask);
</programlisting>
    <para>The previous example only needed one vector so it used <systemitem>msg</systemitem> twice in the call to <systemitem>vec_perm</systemitem>. The Altivec code is similar to <systemitem>_mm_shuffle_epi8</systemitem> on Intel machines. An example that interleaves two different vectors is shown below.</para>
    <programlisting>uint32x4_p a = { 0,  0,  0,  0};  // All 0 bits
uint32x4_p b = {-1, -1, -1, -1};  // All 1 bits
uint8x16_p m = {0,1,2,3, 16,17,18,19, 4,5,6,7, 20,21,22,23};
uint32x4_p c = vec_perm(a, b, m);
</programlisting>
    <para>After the code above executes the vector <systemitem>c</systemitem> will have the value <systemitem>{0, -1, 0, -1}</systemitem>.</para>
    <para>Below is the image IBM provides for the <systemitem>vec_perm</systemitem> documentation. The IBM example shows <systemitem>d = vec_perm(a, b, c)</systemitem>. The light gray blocks in vector <systemitem>d</systemitem> are from the first vector, and dark gray blocks in vector <systemitem>d</systemitem> are from the second vector.</para>

    <title>Effective addresses</title>
    <para>Some vector operations, like loads and stores, can be sensitive to the alignment of a memory address. Operations like <systemitem>vec_ld</systemitem> and <systemitem>vec_st</systemitem> are sensitive, and the documentation clearly states it.</para>
    <para>The effective address is a simple sum consisting of the memory address plus the offset into the address with the result rounded down to a multiple of 16. Effective addresses follow integer arithmetic and not pointer arithmetic.</para>
    <para>You can calculate an effective address using the following code. Notice the bottom 4 bits are masked after calculating the sum to yield a multiple of 16.</para>

</programlisting>
    <para><systemitem>vec_ld</systemitem> takes a pointer and an offset to load a value into a VSX register. Each of the following yield the same VSX register value because the effective addresses are the same. (Old x86 programmers should reminisce on  segmented memory).</para>

int off2 = 16;
uint8x16_p r2 = vec_ld(off2, ptr2);
</programlisting>
    <para>The following also yields the same VSX register value because the effective address is the same. If you truly wanted to load 4 bytes beyond <systemitem>ptr</systemitem> then you loaded the wrong value because <systemitem>(0x401010+4)&amp;0xfffffff0 = 0x401010</systemitem>.</para>

      The <ulink url="https://openpowerfoundation.org/?resource_lib=64-bit-elf-v2-abi-specification-power-architecture">OpenPOWER ELF V2 ABI Specification</ulink>, version 1.4, incorrectly states that accessing vectors on Power should preferably be done with vector pointers and the dereference operator *.  However, this is only permitted for aligned vector references.  Examples in Chapter 6 of the ABI document show use of casting operations that represent undefined behavior according to the C standard.  An errata document that corrects the ABI may be found <ulink url="https://openpowerfoundation.org/?resource_lib=openpower-elfv2-errata-elfv2-abi-version-1-4">at the OpenPOWER Foundation website</ulink>.  Subsequent sections describe the proper way to use loads and stores of aligned and unaligned data.
