  <para>The POWER8-crypto book provides instructions for a Ubuntu system. If you install on Fedora then you will need to manually tune the path to the DocBook stylesheets. This manual change is due to limitations in DocBook. DocBook does not allow us to conditionally include a local file. Also see <ulink url="https://stackoverflow.com/q/4471992">How to import stylesheets in xslt conditionally?</ulink> and <ulink url="https://stackoverflow.com/q/5765886">How to overcome differences in location of docbook style files</ulink> on Stack Overflow.</para>
  <para>To make the change on Fedora open the file <systemitem>custom.xsl</systemitem> and locate the line <systemitem>&lt;xsl:import href="/usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/docbook-xsl/fo/docbook.xsl"/&gt;</systemitem>. Change it to the location of the stylesheet, like <systemitem>/usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets-1.79.2/fo/docbook.xsl</systemitem>.</para>
  <para>The location will be dependent on the package you install. The location <systemitem>/usr/share/sgml/...</systemitem> is due to installing the Fedora package <systemitem>docbook-style-xsl</systemitem>, which is Norman Walsh's XSL stylesheets for DocBook.</para>
  <para>Other packages you may need on Fedora include <systemitem>docbook-dtds</systemitem>, <systemitem>docbook-style-xsl</systemitem>, <systemitem>docbook-utils</systemitem> and <systemitem>docbook-utils-pdf</systemitem>.</para>
